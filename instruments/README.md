# instruments/ — measurement is maintained infrastructure

A capture recipe that lives as prose gets re-derived by whoever needs
it next, under pressure, usually wrong. Everything here is a module
held to the same review bar as the kernel: the probes that convict bugs
are code, committed, and runnable by anyone.

## idle-zero

The economic floor of the whole library, gated in CI: mounted quiescent
Surfaces cost **0 paints/s**. `npm run gate:idle-zero`.

- `main.ts` — the page under test and the assertion. Mounts N sources,
  measures paint deltas across a quiet window, then *provokes* a real
  DOM mutation. Both halves matter: a zero-delta result is vacuous
  unless a provocation proves the `onpaint` wiring was live at all.
- `run.mjs` — transport. Finds Chrome, proves the origin-trial surface
  exists, serves the page, drives it, judges the numbers under a hard
  90s deadline.

Two policies in `run.mjs` are the durable part, and any future
browser-driving instrument should copy them:

- **Capability absence is environmental, not a regression.**
  `drawElementImage` is an origin-trial API, so a Chrome without it
  makes the gate warn loudly and exit 0 (`STRICT_CAPABILITY=1` turns
  that into a failure where the capability is supposed to exist). Past
  a successful capability probe, everything is real: a page error, a
  timeout, or a nonzero idle delta all fail.
- **The launch flags are part of the measurement.**
  `--enable-features=CanvasDrawElement` plus
  `--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows` and
  `--disable-renderer-backgrounding` — a backgrounded renderer stops
  compositing, and a gate that measures "no paints" must never let
  throttling manufacture that result for the wrong reason. A driver that
  silently drops these flags hands back numbers from a browser that
  cannot do the thing being measured.

## House rules

- A scene that can't be interrogated from the console isn't done.
  Scenes hang their live state on a `window.__<scene>` hook.
- `readPixels` is only valid inside a wrapped `gl.render` call.
  Sampling outside one manufactures results, and those results have
  indicted innocent code before.
- Termination of a flight is *the trace stopping*, never a null poll —
  the flight reference outlives the flight.
- Crispness checks are scale-blind unless they are position-aware: a
  texture landing in the wrong place at the wrong size will pass a
  naive sharpness check.
- To bisect a dead effect into "the shader never ran" versus "the
  driver never sent anything", force the uniform inside the render
  wrapper.

The instruments those last four rules describe are not built yet;
they are tracked as issues rather than listed here, so this file
stays a description of what exists.
